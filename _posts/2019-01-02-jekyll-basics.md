### Why Github Pages and Jekyll?

#### Jekyll is Simple and has Free Hosting

Jekyll doesn't add any bloat to the website or blog you are working on. Many of the Jekyll themes are very minimal and content oriented. Hosting a website on Github pages costs nothing and Github is seldom down.

#### Jekyll is Secure
Static websites will not have any database to manipulate. Your Jekyll website will be encrypted in Https on Github Pages. That doesn't mean it is unhackable, but Jekyll is a 100 times safer than Wordpress.

#### Jekyll is Fast
Faster than any Wordpress site. Your website will perform much faster, as the server does not need to parse any content. It only needs to read plain HTML. Static sites rule, and so will you.
