In this tutorial I will show you how to make you free website with Jekyll and Github Pages.

The great thing about this is to get the initial site setup we can get this done fast. From there its just a matter of adding your content. More on that later. To begin got to [github.com](github.com) 

Once on the home page of github we want to create an account. Before you do this think of what you want to call your website. This is important to use this as the username as this will be part of your free url. So if you have something in mind type it in and see if its available (it will tell you right away.) If it is then great!

From there let's go to [jekyllthemes.io](jekyllthemes.io) and lets choose a theme to use to start. Go to the Free themes section and browse. Think about what your site is going to be and choose one. When you click on the the theme you will see a red button with the github logo inside that reads "Get nameoftheme". Click on this. From here you will go to the github repository for this theme. On the top right corner of the screen you should see a button called Fork. Click on this. 

You have now forked the theme you are interested in. There are 2 reasons you would Fork. One is to make a contribution to a theme and the other is to use it as a starting point for your website. We are using it for the latter. Now remember how we chose your username carefully? Go into  Settings tab and where it says repository name change to your usersname.github.io and click OK. You have now renamed the repository and that will be your free url of the site.
